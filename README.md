# 🧮 Loan Data Analysis: Exploring Borrower Risk and Loan Outcomes

## 📌 Objective
This project answers the central question:

> **What borrower characteristics are most associated with loan outcomes and potential lending risk?**

Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we identify patterns related to employment status, debt-to-income ratio, and borrower rates that influence whether a loan ends up closed or remains open.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Context
The dataset is sourced from **Prosper**, a peer-to-peer lending platform, and contains:

- **113,937 loan records**
- **81 variables** on each loan, including:
  - Loan amount
  - Borrower rate
  - Loan status
  - Borrower income
  - Credit score
  - Employment status, and more

This data-rich environment enables deep insight into borrower behavior and real-world lending dynamics.

## 💡 Why This Matters
Understanding the patterns that distinguish **closed vs. open loans** can help:

- 🔍 Identify risk indicators early
- 💼 Adjust loan offers based on borrower profiles
- 📊 Develop more fair and data-driven lending models

This analysis guides the reader through the **most relevant insights**, using clean visuals and a structured narrative to connect **data to decisions**.

## 📈 Key Insights Preview
🔹 Employment status and debt-to-income ratio are strong predictors of loan outcomes.  
🔹 Loans with higher borrower rates and lower incomes tend to remain open.  
🔹 Visualizations clearly reveal clusters of high-risk borrower profiles.
